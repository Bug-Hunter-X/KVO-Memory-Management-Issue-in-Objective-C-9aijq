# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential crash related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) in Objective-C.  Specifically, failure to remove an observer before the observed object is deallocated can lead to unexpected crashes.  The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The issue stems from not removing an observer using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` before the observed object is deallocated. This can cause a crash, especially under memory pressure or with specific timing conditions. The crash may be difficult to reproduce consistently, making it a challenging bug to identify.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the observer is always removed in the appropriate dealloc method or when the observation is no longer needed.  This prevents the KVO mechanism from attempting to interact with a deallocated object.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the application; observe the crash in the problematic code.
4. Compile and run the solution to verify the fix.
