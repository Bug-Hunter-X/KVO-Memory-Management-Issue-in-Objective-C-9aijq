In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing error can occur when dealing with KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  Specifically, if an observer is not removed properly before the observed object is deallocated, a crash can result. This is often masked because it may not manifest immediately, but only under specific memory pressure or timing conditions.

Example of problematic code:

    // ... Handle KVO change ...
}

- (void)someMethod {
